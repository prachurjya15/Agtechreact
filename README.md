#### Reason for using create-react-app

  

Webpack still intimidates me. Babel still intimidates me. ESlint still intimidates me. I know how to use all three but whenever I do I feel like I'm not doing it right and that I'm missing out on something that everyone else knows. `create-react-app` encompasses all of these tools with a set of hard defaults. 

### Step by step introduction to the UI

1. After completing the necessary steps to build the web application, the landing page of "AgTech" briefs the user on what AgTech wishes to achieve.
2. The user needs to first log in to the server to avail all the services.
3. The 'Services' section contains a list of all the features that has been implemented for the benifit of the farmers. A short description has also been provided alongwith the links to the respective features.
4.  The 'Distribution' section is the initial and currently the most significant feature. It asks the user to choose their crop and then performs prediction to determine the best conditions for the farmer to generate more revenue.
5. The 'Experts' section enables the farmers to increse their technical abilities through online as well as on site services provided by the experts.
6. The 'Equipments' section boasts about a wide array of different agricultural equipments that are up for hire and farmers can easily procure them.
