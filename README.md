### [](https://github.com/10XMairing/SiemensAgtech#reason-for-using-typescript)Reason for using create-react-app 

Webpack still intimidates me. Babel still intimidates me. ESlint still intimidates me. I know how to use all three but whenever I do I feel like I'm not doing it right and that I'm missing out on something that everyone else knows. `create-react-app` encompasses all of these tools with a set of hard defaults. I know the Babel it ships with just works although some features are absent.
